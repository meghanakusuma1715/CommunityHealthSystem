# Community Health Outbreak Prevention System

## Overview
This project implements a simple system to monitor community health indicators (reported fever cases) and detect potential disease outbreaks. It uses a threshold-based approach to flag outbreaks and generates alerts with intervention suggestions.

## Files
- `health_data.csv`: Minimal dataset of weekly reported cases (5 weeks).
- `outbreak_detector.py`: Python script for data aggregation, outbreak detection, alert generation, and visualization.
- `outbreak_plot.png`: Plot showing reported cases and outbreak threshold.

## How to Run
1. Install Python 3.8+ and required libraries (`pip install pandas matplotlib`).
2. Run `python outbreak_detector.py` to load data, detect outbreaks, generate alerts, and view/save the plot.

## Features
- **Data Aggregation**: Loads and processes health data.
- **Outbreak Detection**: Flags weeks with cases > 50 as outbreaks.
- **Alert System**: Outputs intervention recommendations for detected outbreaks.
- **Visualization**: Plots cases over time with a threshold line.

## Requirements Met
- **AI/ML**: Uses a rule-based algorithm for outbreak detection.
- **Critical Thinking**: Balances threshold to avoid false alarms while catching outbreaks.
- **Problem Solving**: Handles sample data and produces actionable alerts.
- **Modular Structure**: Separates data loading, detection, alerts, and visualization.
- **Clear Architecture**: Pipeline from data to recommendations.

## Deliverable
An early warning system that detects outbreaks and suggests interventions (e.g., increase testing).
